## zros
zros (Zig and Rust os) is an kernel to learn how it's working.
Crappy and dirty code is expected :)

Why no rust ? Because rust will come when userspace will work

Big thanks to devse admins to make me do this thing (inspired of them)

Roadmap (FROM the devse meme generator):
GDT -> IDT -> SIMD -> PMM -> VMM -> PAGING -> ACPI -> APIC -> IOAPIC 
-> LAPIC -> HPET -> APIC-TIMER -> SMP -> Multitasking -> Syscalls 
-> Userspace -> The fun begin
